-1,Loved the open shoulders  but not how large and flowy the rest of it was. i could have worn it 9 months preggo ;),Blouses
-1,I was drawn to this top because of the interesting and detailed straps  which are embroidered with a lovely triangle pattern. however the embroidery takes away any stretchy-ness or give in the cotton and makes the top a beautiful but ill-fitting harness for anyone with any breasts or full-figured lusciousness. the worst part is that the top hem along the top is embroidered and rigid just like the straps  so it feels like you are wearing an uncomfortable strapless top. i wanted to keep this but h,Blouses
-1,I just can't get past how different the blouse i got is from the photo. mine has dark colors  really dark colors.  this top fits a bit large and the neck is quite wide. i thought it flowed well and fit nicely in my regular size large. i liked the length and the fact that it's shorter than shown. it still covered my bum.  the back has a cute peplum ruffle and there are little bronze colored beads along the bottom edge in both the front and back. i would have kept it had been the blouse shown in t,Blouses
-1,I recently purchased this blouse on their 40% off sale in white. i was hoping for a crisp white structured blouse. i did read all the reviews and thought i would give it a try anyway. it is awful. there is no structure or shape but the quality is the reason i am returning. it feels like a napkin or thinner. not even worth the extra sale price. i will be returning.,Blouses
-1,I can not imagine the cut in the waist being flattering on anyone. i ordered an xs and an xxs still would have flared too much in the waste. i ignored the previous review and that was a huge mistake!,Blouses
-1,This top is tight across the bust (i am a 32dd cup) and more trapeze-shaped than the picture shows. if you are smaller busted  it may not flare out as much. also- the sz 10 is what was tight - and i usually wear a sz. 4 or 6  or small-size top/blouse. in the end  this wasn't very flattering as it looked more like a maternity top.,Blouses
-1,Cute top but started disintegrating after two washes. the delicate cutouts in the top tore apart. i machine washed it in the gentle cycle and didn't use the dryer. disappointed to have to discard the top after just buying it.,Blouses
-1,Looks like a pregnancy top. a lot gathers in front and back. added 10 pounds to me. not flattering on  much longer than on the model. and the color is not white. it's white with a weird tan/ taupe stripe.  i returned it same day i received it  which was disappointing.,Blouses
-1,I splurged on this top and was sadly disappointed. i'm a 36d  and the l was so tight i couldn't get it over my chest. also the arms were super tight and the length is nearly cropped.  and the fabric is shiny  the picture makes it look like it's matte. if it did fit like the model i would've loved it. the print is beautiful though. bummer,Blouses
0,Do not under estimate the boxy shape of this it looks kind of like a hospital scrub. i think with this top the styling is key. the sleeves are long and boxy and the neckline is somewhat of an oval so for me this wasn't a top i could just throw on without doing some outfit editing.i styled this with a dark high waisted skinny jean which i tucked the shirt into and some red heels and i was ready to go. anyways the material was great it was a silk type polyester that didn't seem to be static prone,Blouses
0,I love the style of this top  and the longer length would be great with leggings and fitted shorts. it's somewhat fitted on the top yet it's a-line shape gives a full swing at the bottom. the ruffled v-neckline is pretty  and i like the longer length of the short sleeves. but with all these attributes  unfortunately they cut the armholes really big  so when you put your arms forward  the sleeves pull against your arms. i was trying to decide if i should keep it anyway  but for $98 dollars i thin,Blouses
0,"The colors in the green shirt are beautiful  however the cut looked like a maternity top on me. i'm 5'6"" 120#  not very busty. must try it on to match the right body type; i'm thinking very tall  wispy   less curves...",Blouses
0,This top has a great pattern that could be worn with many different things. it was a bit short for me  as i have a long torso  but i wish it had fit right!,Blouses
0,The quality of this shirt is great and the colors are pretty. it just made me look super wide. i feel like the waist is too high - not quite empire and not quite at the waist. it just wasn't going to work for my body. maybe a different size would work but i don't like it enough to try.,Blouses
0,I loved this shirt online and ordered it in blue immediately even though i usually hesitate to spend over $100 on casual blouses. unfortunately  i was super disappointed when it arrived. the lace does not contrast as much as shown in these pictures and it just doesn't look all that special. having said that  it is super comfy and soft and the sizing is generous - it may run big on you if you have a small chest. all in all  i would buy it on sale but certainly not worth the price tag!,Blouses
0,I was so excited to receive this shirt. it is a beautiful color and material and very well made. i loved the lace detail and wanted to love the shirt. however  i put it on and the seem hit right at the top of my bust. it broadened my shoulders and the fabric started right at my bust so it flowed down from there making me look boxy and wide. i am a 32dd  5'3  and 115 pounds for reference. if you are more narrow and don't have a chest this would be absolutely adorable but sadly for me it had to go,Blouses
0,Drawn to the colors  i tried on the top in my regular size m. fyi: 36c  broad shoulders/back  short waist  size 10/12 or l in fitted tops  this top is a cropped  even for my short-waisted body. i would have to wear a cami under. this is not just because of the cropped length (top rides up w/ any movement)  but the burn-out velvet is quite sheer. the top is full  so it easily exposes with any movement. the back of slides up  too. the quality is an issue  with exposed threads and irregular seams.,Blouses
0,This top is beautiful aesthetically  and i liked the tunic length. the bottom lace is cut out  so make sure things are adequately covered if you wear this with leggings. the fit is flattering.  however  i had some issues with the sizing. i usually wear an xs or a s in tops. the body of both sizes yielded a boxy fit for me  which is seen on the model.. i tried the top with a belt  which looked nice. however  the thing that stopped me from keeping the top was the shoulder/armpit/sleeve area. the s,Blouses
1,This top is perfect! very comfortable and flattering for any body type.,Blouses
1,This top is gorgeous. the colors are lovely  design and quality are impeccable  and it is versatile. this top just happened to catchc my eye and i am so happy with my purchase. it fits tts. i love it!!,Blouses
1,I ordered both colors in size xl and they're each now favorite purchases. the fit is true to size--it matches the photos. the orange/white/brown/red combo works great with the orange version of the indra tassel necklace.  the tops are sheer so i wear a tank underneath. the green floral version will have some variations because of pattern placement. both are so unique & charming! i've been pairing them with different retailer cardigans & necklaces. they've washed well too--in a mesh bag on gentle &,Blouses
1,This is a fantastic top to wear with the paige high wasted flair jeans. love it,Blouses
1,Hands down  my new favorite top! love the look of this top! i would say this runs a little big. i definitely could have sized down. however  the flowy style of my usual retailer size works for me in this piece.,Blouses
1,This flew out of my local store so fast i had to order on line. simply stunning. was reluctant to pay high price but worth it. will get much wear.,Blouses
1,Tried in store today and found to fit tts. images are accurate in terms of color and showing that there is a tiny bit of sheerness to this (as you can see near the bottom in each photo). i really loved everything about it except that it flared out a bit on the bottom in a way that i'd probably fuss with too much. id probably buy it on sale  but not before that.,Blouses
1,"I had been eyeing this top online  decided to hit my local retailer to try it on! it is an adorable spring tunic! i think it runs a size larger then your usual size. for reference  i am 5'7"" and 139 pds  small busted  and i bought a size 6  fits perfect. i will machine wash and hang to dry. happy with my purchase!",Blouses
1,This is a really pretty top. the beading/rivet detail is really cool and it feels comfortable on. i think the lining is really silky and the lace feels gentle  not stiff. the top is kind of like a swing top  there is a lot of fabric  but it is just right. the fabric looks rich and lovely. great top!,Blouses
-1,"I'm 5'7""  130 lbs. i ordered a medium-regular. the dress fell three inches above my knees. this model is taller than i am  and it falls to her knees....doesn't make sense. i think retailer sends petites in place of regular.",Dresses
-1,I loved the color and design of this dress but needed to return it because it fit so poorly. the arm holes are entirely too big -- so big that alternations couldn't fix it. maybe it's because i am petite but i think it may be a design flaw.,Dresses
-1,This dress looks and feels cheap. the white material is stiff and does not iron nicely. the grey sweater is super thin and very cheap looking. overall  a pretty horrible dress. save your money ,Dresses
-1,I love the dress as shown in the photo. thankfully i had a chance to see the dress in the store. it is sheer. can see thru it. can not wear this to work.,Dresses
-1,Looks great  the material feels great but when i put this dress on for the first time today it fell apart at the seams in the rib cage area. total disappointment! i had purchased this on sale for my graduation and was getting ready to walk out the door when i saw two holes on each side!,Dresses
-1,I had fallen in love with the coral dress that was somewhat like this one and came out a few months ago. but the problem i'm having with this one is the same problem i had with the coral one. they are all flawed in their construction! i had eventually tried 3 size 16s in the coral because each one was flawed. on one  one side hung longer than the other  and on all 3  the top design did not line up with the bottom design. this blue one is the same way! the top design does not line up with the bot,Dresses
-1,I don't normally write reviews  but i purchased this dress in white in 3 different sizes and each dress had the same flaw. the hems were very uneven on all three. this dress was poorly sewn. it's a shame because it looked awesome online. i was very disappointed!!!!!,Dresses
-1,I waited six weeks for this dress to arrive and was so disappointed. loved the skirt part of it. but the top  which i guess i didn't see in photo was pleated as well  made my bust look huge and it puffed out on sides. would have been a wonderful summer dress  flowing and cool.,Dresses
-1,The fabric and color are absolutely beautiful. the shape of the dress is strange - fitted and tight through the waist  and enormous everywhere else. it was not flattering.,Dresses
0,Unfortunately this dress ran very large on me (please no more vanity sizing!) and minimized what few curves i have. my store didn't have this in petite so i tried a regular xs - the neckline was low and there were at least 4 inches of space at the waist. it also flares out quite a bit  you can see this in the catalog shot. while this wasn't flattering on me  it may work better on curvier figures.,Dresses
0,This dress is everything i hoped it would be--bright  colorful  quality jacquard  classic silhouette. unfortunately it runs small up top on the bust and i couldn't even zip it up all the way. returning :(,Dresses
0,I am normally a size 8 in dresses and bought this in a small. so if you are a smaller person  this would likely be a bit loose on you. the color was odd. i liked the navy blue  but the pink was a pepto bismol colored pink. i just felt like i would get sick of the color/pattern after one wear. the fit is cute and comfy.,Dresses
0,This dress is very cute on the model online  but in person it is quite large and just hands there and doesn't do much for the figure. cute but not worth the $148 price tag.,Dresses
0,I love  love  love byron lars dresses. they fit my curves like a glove. but this one... i guess it would have fit me like a glove. but i live alone  and at the moment i don't have enough money to hire a lady's maid  and so i couldn't actually tell. it buttons all the way up the back  so you cannot put it on yourself  unless you are a contortionist. wanted to love this but can't.,Dresses
0,I was surprised at the high quality of fabric; however  the dress looked like a muumuu on. maybe with a belt it would be cuter...,Dresses
0,The colors are beautiful and the fabric is very soft and comfortable. i will be returning because of issues with length and being low cut.    for reference i am 5'5 145lbs  38-30-40  34ddd. the dress was low cut and showed too much cleavage for my comfort  but this may not be an issue for women with smaller breasts (or if you don't mind some cleavage showing). this length was also a bit too long  so if you are 5'5 or shorter you may want to order the petite size.,Dresses
0,I love the look of this dress and i love the way it is cut. the one thing i do not love is the thickness of the material. it is just too much for a summer dress. it just felt heavy and hot. i still love this brand so i am hopeful for a few more great options to come out before summer is over.,Dresses
0,I bought this on sale thinking it was a great deal  but when it came in i found it to fit like a totally unflattering sack. the pattern didn't help anything  looking totally faded and washed out...the fabric and overall quality is nice  but the fit and pattern are just so..ugly  unfortunately. had to return it.,Dresses
1,I absolutely adore this dress. i took my time buying it and when i was ready to purchase they were sold out of my normal size 6 but the 8 was still available  so i snagged it. i'm glad because the dress runs small and the size 6 would have been snug around the waist. the style is perfect and the dress is well made. the material is a heavier cotton and the white banding accents it perfectly. i don't think it's too white  like some reviewers have stated. you can't wear a bra with this dress  but t,Dresses
1,I am a fan of these designers and their gorgeous fabrics - most of which are heavy brocades. this is so pretty and fun. the print is playful  and colors are gorgeous  and the fit is floaty but not too full or too tight. i love the bit of beading  and that i can dress it up or down.    i am petite and not usually a bigger print or long dress fan  but i know that i will wear this one for years.     i did get a 00 petite as i know that only this small size fits me at retailer - 0's swallow me. this i,Dresses
1,I'm 5 ft 3 inches  130 lbs. this dress fits perfect! i bought a 4r. the petite 4 probably would have fit and been a inch or two shorter but i don't the regular looked bad. it hits an inch or two below my knee. medium thickness of fabric is forgiving even though the dress hugs in all the right places. beautiful dress!!,Dresses
1,I am usually drawn to more color but the vertical and horizontal lines of this dress made me curious. the fit is absolutely incredible! i like the fact that it is very easy to put on without any zippers or buttons as well. it hugs your body in all the right places. i had no issue with the dress riding up and the way the designer placed the lines makes this one even more flattering. gorgeous dress!!,Dresses
1,"I love this sweater dress! i was hesitant to order it after reading some of the reviews  but fear not  friends--this is a comfortable  flattering  warm dress with a unique twist. i love the cowl and the buttons down the back. the knit is fairly large so there's some give to it  which means pulling it on is a breeze  and the buttons don't slip out of their closures unexpectedly  which is an added bonus. i ordered both grey and navy. i stand at 5'6"" and would describe myself as pear-shaped  typica",Dresses
1,"It's relatively light material; even if you layered a sweater over this i can't see it being good for winter. i'm in california so it's fine :) length is great - i'm 5""4 and it hits just at the knee. i'm a true size 2/small and this fit great  even though i have a curvier figure. pretty classic dress.",Dresses
1,"I love this dress. i live in maxi dresses versus shorts in the summer and this is the perfect cut  weight and quality. i did have to order it in petite or else i was stepping on the bottom (unless really high heels). i am 5'5""  so i would say that it runs long. offer this cut in more colors!!",Dresses
1,"This is such an easy dress to wear and it looks very polished! it is not a ""cheap polyester"" fabric as one reviewer wrote. it is a rayon and nylon blend. it does wrinkle easily. i love that the belt is actually sewn into the dress at the back. i don't typically gravitate toward warm color palette  but the burnt orange color is really lovely. it can be dressed up or down very easily. and it has pockets! i typically wear xs in retailer brands  and the size 0 fit me well.",Dresses
1,This is one of those just throw on and go dresses that i love. it is breezy and easy  comfortable  but also polished and lovely with some really nice design features and a beautiful mixed print. you can wear it with some cute flip-flops  or polish it up with some cute boots.,Dresses
-1,The sweater material was really soft and seemed well-made. the back is an interesting twist  but the material creases easily; i can see it looking messy by the end of the day. the main reason i returned it though was because it runs very large. i got my usual s  and i could have sized down 1  maybe even 2 sizes. i didn't like it enough to try a smaller size.,Fine gauge
-1,Based on the strength of the other reviews  i thought this sweater would be amazing  but i was disappointed. the knit is very thin  cheap looking and weak that it won't last a season undamaged. it reminds me of a duster i bought 15 years ago at a discount fast-fashion retailer when i was a student. sloppy looking with lots of creases out of the package. collar is odd and the sleeve openings have an annoying flare. the drape is not structured enough--everything about this screams over priced bath,Fine gauge
-1,I was expecting elbow-to-full-length sleeves and like a previous review noted  they were short. very weird look for a wrap. returned.,Fine gauge
-1,I wanted to love this sweater and it has some nice distinctive features that make it more interesting than your average cardigan. unfortunately  however  i found that flared in an unflattering manner over my stomach. the chest fit well - though it was very low cut - but then if i buttoned the sweater it made me look like at least three sizes larger.  the quality seemed okay  but a bit thin and i was afraid that this would not hold up for long.,Fine gauge
-1,Didn't like at all. itchy fabric  looked good on model but on on busty girl.,Fine gauge
-1,The top looks better on the model than in-person. it fits loose and looks boxy and matronly. i don't like the sleeve length or the top style  it just didn't look flattering or good. i am sending it back. looks very boxy.,Fine gauge
-1,Runs small. arms very short and hits in the wrong place across your chest. would not recommend.,Fine gauge
-1,I'm returning this cardigan. it doesn't fit me at all. it's shapeless and loose.,Fine gauge
-1,I really liked the design. ordered a medium which was huge. also thought i would not be able to tolerate it because of the material -- a bit itchy. returned it.,Fine gauge
0,This is a beautiful sweater that i wanted to love but i couldn't for a few reasons i thought i'd share: the color is bright orange. it is not softer like peach in the picture. it also was more clingy than a curvy woman like me can wear. i thought'd be more swingy but it was more structured. very pretty and good quality tho.,Fine gauge
0,This sweater is great i bought the black version on sale. my complaint is the pulling factor though. you don't expect retailer sweaters to pill after a couple wears. overall i love the fit and look though so i continue to overlook it and use my sweater comb as needed!,Fine gauge
0,I really like the color of this and the feel  but that is where it ends. it does not come with the gorgeous flattering belt that it is pictured with  and is cut without shape so it does not fit to your body and show off any glorious womanly curves. i could purchase the belt with it  but i don't prefer to purchase products that cannot stand on their own.,Fine gauge
0,"Purchased because i wanted a deep red sweater  and this one was the perfect color. unfortunately i am on the curvier side  with 34g chest  155lbs 5' 5""  and the med was too big  (i usually wear m or l at retailer.) also the fit ended up being boxy on my body type.",Fine gauge
0,I ended up returning it just because it didn't do much for my current postnatal figure  but otherwise this top is just so pretty and unique!,Fine gauge
0,"I'm usually a small (5'5""  116 lbs  long torso)  but the x-small fit well. the black does look see-through in the pictures  but i figured i could wear a cami with it. it is see-through in person if you are up close  mainly in the back and arms since the front has extra fabric in places. however  it is rather short  possibly because it is an x-small  and i'll need a short cami to fit under it or will have to have a cami hanging out of the bottom  which drapes nicely and a cami may mar that effect",Fine gauge
0,I love this sweater  so why a lower rating? while i love the material and the color  it lost all of its shape before i even left the house! i am a size 6 / small and it looked clownish on me before i ever got to my dinner party.  i plan to wash it this evening and i really hope that this brings it back to its original shape and keeps it.,Fine gauge
0,I love the colors in this top  but sadly i'm going to have to return it. the first thing my husband did when he saw this on me was just stare  and not in a good way. then he said it looked like a maternity top. i was so disappointed  and sadly will be returning this. for reference  i am 135 pounds. 5-ft. 4-in tall and do not want to look pregnant in a top. i normally wear size medium tops  but this one is huge. now i know why the model in the picture had her arms nestled in at her sides. this to,Fine gauge
0,"I tried this sweater on in the store. i wanted to love it so badly as it is soft and feminine  and would be a great causal layering piece. however  there are pockets in the sweater that are right on seam  and they actually bubble out from the natural drape of the sweater. not to mention  unless you're built very narrow  the pockets will fall at  and accentuate hips  and not in a flattering way. the nice details are the feel of the knit  the layered style  with a cottony lined hood and ""faux"" lay",Fine gauge

1,Love  love  love. i have both colors and wear with leggings. it's not a heavy sweater and has a great drape  super flattering. i'm usually a medium and it runs true to size - not supposed to be tight. i find it a little low in the front but a tank underneath takes of it. washes well.,Fine gauge

1,This sweater is very warm yet light. the pink color is very cute  and the buttons are detailed very nicely! it hangs a bit low under the arms  and definitely tightens at the wrist. i ordered the xs size  and i find that i am unable to push the sleeves up. this is so beautiful and has a subtle uniqueness.,Fine gauge

1,"I thought this sweater was cute online but turns out it is even cuter in person! the cotton linen blend makes it easy to layer over a tee shirt or blouse  and the neutral color goes with everything!  as a side note  included with my sweater was a signed postcard informing me that this item was not on hand at their distribution center. so they ""sounded the horns""  and their spokane  wa store ""saved the day"". thank you spokane  wa store and thank you meredith for packing with care!   i love it!",Fine gauge
1,"This sweater is the reason i shop at retailer - unique  cute & comfy! the yellow really isn't 'one of my colors' but it's so different that i had to get it. and the cut is so flattering  that i had to go back to get the purple! it may run a tad bit generously; i'm 5'4""  124 lbs  34d and originally got the small. i wound up returning and getting the xs. that sizing was slightly more form-fitting  without being clingy.we had a hint of fall weather in colorado  so i immediately threw the yellow versi",Fine gauge
-1,3 tags sewn in  2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however  this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!,Intimates
-1,"Loved how this draped and im super petite 5'1""(32b bust) and this was seriously one of the most ill fitting items i have every owned. i purchased the pxs and it was huge. i hope this has a better fit as the other reviewers seem to have a more positive review. i was just appalled as to how bad the measurements were off. unfortunately the straps are not adjustable so this went below my chest. too sad retailer  please get the fit right!!",Intimates

-1,This bra runs very small  and is hard to get on and off. i think if i went a size up i would be happier.,Intimates
-1,It seemed to stay in place and did not require constant readjustment. however  i found the band to be extremely small and tight. it is not the most comfortable bra because of the way the band just presses into your skin.,Intimates
-1,The first time i wore this tank it started pilling around the arms and down the sides. it is terribly quality  and gets worse with every wear and wash. possibly the worst wear on a new clothing item i've ever seen. like the design and fit  immediately relegated it to a weekend/home shirt because it was unprofessionally pilly and the pills are small so can't be shaved off.,Intimates
-1,"Got this in the sky color. returned it because the top is way too sheer for me  if you know what i mean. i wanted a pretty gown i can wear without a robe in front of my kids. no can do. also  for the price  material just felt flimsy & cheap. it does run small ~ the medium was good on me and i'm 5'2""  114#  34b",Intimates
-1,You have to be a contortionist to get this bra on. it slips over your head and i needed my 8yo daughter to help me pull it down past my elbows. ridiculously impractical. why oh why didn't heather give it a hook and loop closure instead?,Intimates
-1,I am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra. it's soft and fits okay  but it has zero support or shape. i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support. if i would have seen this is the store  i would have passed over it. however  i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it. it's comfortable so that's a redeeming quality. i would not recommend for larger chested ladies  though!,Intimates
0,As a petite  big busted woman  i found this dress wildly unflattering. the quality and pattern of the dress itself is beautiful  though it will require a slip as it is completely transparent. the design of the bust however  i found unflattering.,Intimates
0,I really was looking forward to this piece but unfortunately it was too small to even pass through my head nevertheless i couldn't even get both arms in. i got a size small and probably needed a large; but as far as the quality and color  it's really pretty! just go up a size or two if anything and try it out.,Intimates
0,I have been eyeing this piece for months now! i broke down and bought it when they finally had my size in stock. i am 5 '4 and 110 lbs and have a very small chest so i ordered an xs. i think the top is too baggy for me. yes  the top and bottoms fit overall  but it doesn't look as nice and form fitting like it does on the model. it is very sheer--which is the thing that discourages me the most. i love the concept of this piece but the execution could use some work  which i am willing to work on s,Intimates
0,I wanted to love this set  but sadly it just didn't fit as i had hoped. the small was bigger than expected and looked frumpy and not sexy. returned.,Intimates
0,This is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house. i'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back  and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping  and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it's a bit scratchy around the edges. i was going to buy another color if i loved this  but as it is i will keep the one,Intimates
0,This is a very nice bra  upset though because this is the second time i have ordered something from retailer and the place that the product was made was incorrect on the website. bra was made in peru and website said usa. makes it very hard to be socially responsible on this website. not sure i will continue to shop retailer in the future because of this.,Intimates
0,I'm a b-cup who hates traditional underwire bras  so i was excited to try this one out. while i appreciate that this bra has more structure and support than other wireless comfy bras  the cups provided too much coverage for my style. if you want to wear a shirt with a wide neck  or do a cute off-the-shoulder thing with your shirt  the top of the cup shows. bummer!,Intimates
0,It is a very pretty bra. light weight and beautiful lace. however  i have yet to find a t-back that does not make me feel like i am going to spill out. to me it ran small. i now know to get a 34 instead. i am working on losing weight  perhaps that might help with the fit?,Intimates
0,When ordering this product  i thought it was strange that the mediums were sold out. i went with the small which is generally what i wear. however  these run small and i see why the medium ran out. they are pretty  however  i wish they made them more true to size.,Intimates

1,Great style and cut  love the deep v. the fabric is soft and its very comfortable. it gives some support. i don't wear it with light blouses or shirts  unless i'm hanging around the house. i have this is pink and black.,Intimates
1,I really love this camisole  but it's shorter than i expected.,Intimates
1,A great long line bra! beautiful and well made however it's tough to get the fit perfectly right. i usually wear a 32 b or 34 a and am 115lbs. the small was the best fit as the 32 (xs) was a very small 32. i could almost say it more of a 30 if that's even a size. it also rubs my skin few places so definitely not meant to be worn for more than a few hours. otherwise i recommend it!,Intimates
1,My bridesmaids gifted this to me at my bridal shower  and of all the lingerie i received that day  this was the most memorable. it is equally romantic and sexy as it is subtly sheer. the delicate eyelash lace detail adds so much flair. i have this in size small and it fits tts. love this piece! i plan to wear this for my boudoir shoot.,Intimates
1,Great piece just wish it fit a bit more blousy rather than cami,Intimates
1,I bought these to have a pair between standard fair and sexy  but these are so comfortable and gorgeous i would wear them everyday! it doesn't even feel like i am wearing anything. love these!,Intimates
1,There may be no inner lining  but it is a gorgeous bra! and so comfortable! the straps and well make and sturdy and the detailing is stunning. it is absolutely true to size. 34c fit like a glove. a winner!,Intimates
1,This is so beautiful! i loved it online  but it's even prettier in person. it's a little greener than it appears in the photo. the straps are actually a green rather than white. i'm 5' 6'' 123 lbs and the xs fits perfectly. worth the money!,Intimates
-1,I was hesitant to buy this because it is double breasted which isn't my first choice. that was the least of the problems with this jacket. i love sparkle  and i love beautiful detail  none of the elements by themselves was a problem. the sum of the parts didn't work  though. the end result was an unflattering  confusing mess. the silhouette plus the frayed edges  plus the sequins plus the vent in back plus the huge buttons plus the double breast  plus the zipper were just too many things to go t,Jackets
-1,1. i like a shorter jacket  but this one was poorly made and poorly fit.  2. the sleeves were way too tight. i'm a size 10 or 12  and the large which would be a 14 had tight sleeves that wrinkled up my arms  and the hem of the sleeve turned inside out.  3. i ordered both a medium (size 10) and a large (size 14)   and neither hung right. the m too tight  and the large too loose in the body and too tight in the sleeves.  4. very polyester with lots of static.  5. cute idea  but not very good in pe,Jackets
-1,This vest looked so cute online but it's a disaster. the quilting is so bulky that the drawstring doesn't work properly and it just hangs. itlooks like something out of a costume closet that could be used for a peasant farmhand or a zombie movie. seriously  it's bad.,Jackets
-1,I was so excited for this kimono. i thought the colors would be lovely. i was looking for a unique wrap/vest/kimono. i ordered this online expecting to be dazzled. sadly  i was not. this arrived and fell short on all measures. the colors were flat  the fabric felt cheap and the construction did not scream $108. it felt like something i would find in a college import/head shop. back it went. i ended up buying the silves wrap  which i love.,Jackets
-1,I ordered this online and was disappointed when it arrived. it didn't look quite like it does in the photos online. it also runs small. i returned it because i did not feel it was worth the high price.,Jackets
-1,This blazer looks great on the model and i have a long torso so i thought it would be perfect. when i got it it looked like a big box and didn't fit anywhere. the shoulder pads were giant and the bottom of the coat was huge. i got a small based on other reviews  but it was way too big. sadly  i had to return it.,Jackets
-1,"The fit is so bad and the construction is very poor. i'm 5'1''  100 lbs  ordered xxs petite.     first of all  when i button this  there is extreme gaping going on. the vest runs narrow  yet tall?it shifts up my torso if i move at all  making the gaping even worse.    the ""skirt"" at the bottom is made of a very cheap  thin  slightly sheeny material that you would find at a flea market. it arrived unbelievably wrinkled and crumpled  and it was just so thin. it did not meet as closely in the middl",Jackets
-1,The color is darker than shown (i ordered the denim looking one). the flower things are not very visible as it all looks one color. it must be great for the tall skinny model   but if your 5'4'' and pear shaped like me  it's a no go! took it back to my local store.,Jackets
-1,Does not look like the picture. lined with a cheap denim fabric inside that shows when arms are rolled up. i normally always fit in mediums and this jacket is so small in the arms as well as body that it fit like a xs.,Jackets
0,"Loved the look of this wool and so well made! problem was it literally would have been better on a bed as a blanket than on my body as a blanket coat. just overwhelmed me and didn't look good. i'm 5/9"" and 160 lbs so i'm no shrinking violet just too heavy of fabric.",Jackets
0,I like how this jacket is very versatile. you can wear it to work  or play. it does have interesting detail on it  i kept it based on the price and those details. i have the olive color. the arms are a little tight.,Jackets
0,This was a fail for me. although i ordered size large it barely fit my midsection when tied and was too small in the waist. the fabric is nice though. best on thinner frames than mine.,Jackets
0,Delaine blazer so many little details with a slight bit of ruggedness. loved the unmatched buttons  checkered back and fraying that gave this piece personality making it appear less stuffy. easyily dress it up or down  that being said it seems to run true to size except the arms and shoulders were very tight. i would consider going up a size if more of an athletic build. ordered a 4 but i think a 6 would have been perfect!,Jackets
0,First  the good: i like the basic shape of the jacket  with its crisply cut lapels  and rounded corners at the bottom...the functional pockets (including the  cool watch pocket)  the size of the buttons  the color. i got the honey   and it was lovely and intense . now  the bad:  i got the regular 8. the jacket is at least an inch too short. although it's  a small  tight 8  the sleeves are strikingly too long. they would have to  be folded  and the lining which would show is not that attractive.,Jackets
0,Ordered this vest in both the xs and pxs. i liked the length and overall fit of the xs  however  i ended up returning both due to how the vest draped. the outer fabric is a bit more stiff which made the vest balloon out more then what i liked. overall  it?s not a terrible vest but just not for me.,Jackets
0,"I agree with a previous reviewer who said that it was very nicely cut  but unfortunately  the materials are so cheap. the ""fleece"" material that it is made out of feels like the cheap polyester fleece blankets that you get at the discount stores. it will pill easily  and is noticeable even in the dark color. i must have gotten one shipped straight from the store  and it was already starting to do some gnarly pilling. i do love the cut of it  but i can't justify keeping it because this won't last",Jackets
0,"How can some reviewers say this jacket is true to size  yet others say it runs small? i think it's because this jacket is cropped. by the time i took advantage of the fall perks 20 percent discount  the xs peach was sold out so i ended up ordering size s. i also got the xs gray to compare. sure enough  the xs looks better but is cropped on me. for ref  i'm 5' 5""  32a  115 lbs. i don't really need another almost black jacket so i'm either sized out or have to exchange for xs peach to wear with dr",Jackets
0,I was searching for the perfect large comfy sweater for the cold winter weather ahead and i thought this would be it. it looks so cute in the pictures but when i received in by mail it wasn't what i was searching for. this sweater  like on the model  is quite large. although i wanted a large sweater  the fit of this one didn't fit well on me. it has more of a boxy feel to it. i usually wear a medium  but went with a small because i expected this to fit a little large and it still engulfed me. i,Jackets
1,The collar from a distance looks like it has seen better days (very scruffy)  but it is so silky soft. and the slight sheen to the jacket is a nice twist to an ordinary army type. the fabric is definitely thinner than i expected  but it&#39;s also softer and better for layering.,Jackets
1,Love everything about this jacket its super soft  thin  and looks great! it's versatile and a great layering piece for someone that lives in a very warm climate! prefer the sleeves to be worn rolled up and the inside belt definitely helps give the piece more shape and dimension!,Jackets
1,Love!!!! i got the green and it goes with so much!,Jackets
1,"I am very happy about the jacket. i like the material and the cut. i was able to wear the jacket for a walk on a rather windy day  about 60 f  with a thin sweater underneath  and it felt comfortable.     the fit is very flattering. i would prefer the sleeves to be a little longer (5'7""  125 lb  got size s). also  i wish the lining was full  not just the front detail - it would allow more versatility. but that's just me...    overall  i like it :))",Jackets
1,If you're very small-framed and/or petite  i would size down in this. unless you want a really slouchy look and fit.   ----------  i have very broad shoulders and very large biceps  and typically wear a m/l in retailer tops. sometimes if a top is a pullover style (as opposed to button-down) i have to size up to a 12 to get the top to accommodate my shoulder width and biceps. so i was leery the size 8/italian 44 would fit  but it does  with room to spare  albeit it is not as loose or long in the ar,Jackets
1,This vest is awesome. it can take any dress/outfit and instantly make it more fancy and formal. the way it drapes is very forgiving and the back bow can be modified and switched out for different colors depending on outfit color. .,Jackets
1,This jacket is perfect!! the denim mixed with the military style is such a good combo. it fits great and is very comfortable. the little ties in the back are a cute addition.,Jackets

-1,I've purchased pilcro jeans in the past and they've held up great. unfortunately  the material used for this particular jean is a far  far cry from what it used to be. the thighs of these jeans start pilling (yes pilling!) after just a few wears. i've never had jeans do this -- whatever denim blend they are using is a complete disaster.    don't buy these -- you will be very disappointed.,Jeans
-1,Bummer  i fell in absolute love with these gems until i realized how weak the stretch is by the end of the day. i purchased them on the 13th of feb and can't bare to wear them anymore.,Jeans
-1,I bought these a great alternative to black jeans but they are headed back.  the texture is nice but let's call them what they are- thin  leggings.  not worth the price in my opinion.  honestly  i can't seem to find a pair of pilcros that i like so i'd spent the extra money on a better pair of black jeans.,Jeans
-1,While you can't count on the photo on your monitor to portray the exact color of an item  these photos are way off.  instead of the warm charcoal i see online  the pants are more of a dusty blue.  the material has very little stretch and i couldn't get into the size 24s.  the 25s were tight in the entire leg but huge in the waist.  for reference i usually wear a size 24 in brands like 7 for all mankind and citizens of humanity.,Jeans
-1,I have quite a few pairs of retailer pants and jeans. my favorites are the cords i got last year  similar to these  so when i saw this fun pair  i had to have them. i ordered both the 32 and the 33 to try on.    they are even more beautiful in person than online. and they are so  so small. it wasn't like they were a tad snug--i couldn't even get the button across to meet the buttonhole. on the 33.    i've never had a problem fitting into retailer pants before. this was an extra-depressing first time,Jeans
-1,"These pants are more like 9"" not 10"". i was very dissappointed. the color is great and so is the fabric.  if you look more closely at the model the pants don't fit her either!! they are too small! i haven't decided whether or not to take them back because i am losing weight. i am a 31 so far but these pants are like a 30. i need the color because they go perfectly with a top i bought from retailer",Jeans
-1,Perhaps i should have gotten two sizes smaller  but the knees on these were baggie by lunch.  they are very soft and comfortable  but i wouldn't buy them again.,Jeans
-1,This picture does not represent these jeans .. the color is way off. they are more yellow toned and look much more worn than in the picture. they also run very small.,Jeans
-1,I loved the look of these pants in the pictures online and i loved the way that they fit. however when i got my pair  the flower placement was completely different. the whole front was black and there were just flowers running out of the crotch seams. i ordered another pair hoping they were just cut wrong  but those were even worse. they looked obscene.,Jeans
0,I ordered these in my usual size and could barely get them on. they fit ike tight leggings. they have spandex that is comfortable and they will probably stretch as you wear them . i exchanged for the next size up  because the style is great for year -round and the quality excellent. i live 2 hours from a store  i would either order up at least one size or try them on in store.,Jeans
0,I am so bummed. these jeans are the perfect weight  totally distressed (and torn) in a way that looks like you've owned them for years  they flare out at the bottom of the legs just the right amount...but there is one huge - or i should write small - problem: your thighs have to be incredibly small to get these pulled all the way on.   ----------  i am a 27 in level 99 and ag brand jeans  and a 28 in my other pairs of coh jeans and in mih jeans as well. i do not have an hourglass figure (my shou,Jeans

1,I honestly  have to give these jeans 5stars.  i loved them when i saw them in the store and had to have them and when i wore them  i got tons of compliments. they are super comfortable too!  i read some of the other reviews and thought that their comments were a little strange.  these jeans are obviously not classic and they will go of style but  if you run a little outside of the style box you will welcome them in your wardrobe.,Jeans
1,"I've been shopping with retailer over 10 years and this is my first review. i almost didn't order after reading negative reviews from petite ladies. i'm 5' 2"" and these jeans are perfection! they look amazing with a 2-3 inch heel. i don't think they are meant to wear with flats since petite people look ridiculous in flats with boot cut or wide leg anyway. love these!",Jeans

1,I normally wear a size 27  but i have a pair of shorts by same designer bought several years ago in a size 26 and so i went with a size 26 for this purchase. they fit perfectly. i would have liked to order the petite  but it did not appear to be an option. the fabric is very soft and stretchy. they are little loose around the ankle  but i have very skinny calves and ankles  so that is not so surprising. the color is a perfect grey that will go with everything. i would buy these in other colors.,Jeans
1,These are adorable and very very comfortable. i'm loving the flattering mid rise. as stated before there is no flare as depicted in the photo but still super cute! nice with flats  easy to dress up with some sexy heels.,Jeans
1,These pants fit comfortably and are really nice on! they're not too bulky and can be worn in a casual way and/or with a formal look. i just wish black jeans didn't always have that odd rubber smell. other than that  these are great!,Jeans
1,"These didn't work for me because i am too straight shaped for these jeans. try them if you have a smaller waist and curvy hips and bottom! i didn't have anything to fill out the hips and seat. for reference  i ordered size 25  and they were loose in hip and seat  but fit my waist. my hips are 34.5"" and waist is 28"". they are a thinner stretch denim than they appear  but not jeggings thin.",Jeans

-1,This shirt had an overpowering vinegar odor when i took it out of the packaging.    the mint green color was appealing but the styling did not look good and the smell was too much.,Knits
-1,I thought from the picture this would be a light floaty top. when it arrived  the fabric was a heavy knit and the neckline sagged very low. on me (granted i'm a pear) the bottom layer hugged my tummy and rear in a very unflattering way. the only thing i liked was the color. back it went.,Knits
-1,It's a cute idea  but it's so low cut and the material is very thin. i was hoping to wear it as a cool  flowing summer top  but i'll have to layer it since my whole bra basically hangs out of it. i'm only keeping it because it was such a good price. also the buttons are super tiny and a little hard to fasten.,Knits
-1,It's such a pretty top but i felt that it looked maternity-ish so i returned it.,Knits
-1,I love the design of this top  however  it's quality is lackluster. the shirt is pretty short and would be more flattering (at least on me) if it had a few more inches. also it's pretty sheer  so figuring out under garments is a dilemma. i will still wear it because i love it. looks great with a denim vest over it!,Knits
-1,I'm always looking for pieces that would good for either layering or worn alone. this looks cute on the model  but when i received it  it's actually very flowing. i wanted more of a straight cut. doesn't work very well on my body. i'm 5'3  123 lbs.  34-d. it's going back.,Knits
-1,This top is very soft and well made. for my short and curvy figure  it is very unflattering. i considered altering it  but there is no way to do it. it gapes in the front and if you have a waist at all  it won't show because this top is boxy and full in that area. if you are tall and slim  it might be perfect  so give it a try.,Knits

0,This would be great on someone with a slim build. it's very true to size  it hits above the hips and runs pretty straight through the body for a boxy look. i loved the color and pointelle detail but on my thicker build it just sort of hung in a too-casual way. note that it is the kind of cotton that is likely to stretch with wear (and spring back with cleaning).,Knits
0,I love the colors in this top  but i returned it for a few reasons.  the material is extremely fragile; with small kids i knew this would be snagged all over after my first day of wearing it.  my other issue was that it came to just below my belt on me.  i was under the impression from the photo that it was more of a tunic style top.  i'm 5'6 and it just didn't look that way on me.,Knits
0,I have to agree with another reviewer - this blouse has an odd fit! the small petite (my usual size) was a good length and there was plenty of room in the body  however i found the shoulders to be quite small which made the neckline pull. since i definitely do not have broad shoulders this may be a particular problem for those that do. i also found the gathered seam above the bustline and across the upper back resulted in an unflattering maternity top effect. the blouse i was sent had one sleeve,Knits
0,Loved the bright pattern online and had hoped it had a similar fit to the tyla ts which i love. in actuality this was a lot boxier. the cut was shorter in length  too short for my 5'10 frame. the width was rather boxy and unflattering  particularly with the wide arm holes and flat cuffed sleeves. also the pattern looked a little cheap in person  way less spectacular than retailers typical gorgeous vibrant patterns. this is going back i'm afraid.,Knits
0,This was my absolute favorite top before it transferred dye onto the driver's seat in my car. >:-( there is nothing in the language of the care tag which advises to wash before wearing because of the possibility of dye transfer to other surfaces. the care instructions say that is is washable with like colors and  in fact  recommends dry cleaning. really? and dry cleaning will remove all of that excess dye? don't think so. after i discovered the dye transfer on my car seat  i washed the top in a,Knits
0,I loved the look of this top the moment i saw it in the store  particularly the muted red color. the crochet detail is very pretty and i found the fit to be quite flattering on me. however  part of the crochet detail on the one i received has a hole that needs to be repaired. since i purchased during the sale  i'm going to try and mend myself  but this may end up having to go back. if you see this in store and find one that is not damaged  i would recommend it!,Knits
1,Love this top  the contrasting lace/eyelet is pretty and interesting. it flairs in a flattering way.,Knits
1,Love the colors and design of this lace-printed top but didn't realize it's not lined. the description says its polyester lace with polyester lining so i assumed it was lined and when you look at the photos  there is a lining under the top. the arm holes are slightly cut-in both front and back so it will be rather difficult to find a camisole with thin straps with a similar cut so they don't show. other than that  it's a beautiful  unique summer top.,Knits
1,I love this piece  it fits well and is comfortable. you can dress it up or be more casual. i have received many compliments already and it goes with many of my outfits.,Knits
1,Ordered this in the white/gray. likely one of the softest tops i own  and drapes beautifully. density of fabric enough that i won't need a tee underneath. design of the pointed front will look great with a shorter jacket. i'm busty and there is a ton of fabric in the front. due to shipping i won't return but could have gone a size down  and i'm a 42dd.,Knits
1,Very flattering  the material is not the softest but it's an easy one to throw on with jeans,Knits
1,I love the style of this top  there's good stretch to the fabric so it's very flattering. the length is good for me  as the previous review stated  it's a little long but for me it's lengthening. the lace is lovely  too. i'll wear it with some white jeans for summer.,Knits
1,This is a nice lightweight summer top to wear with a pair of shorts. it is low cut though - lower than i expected so i wear a tank underneath it. the layers are flattering.,Knits
1,I can't say enough about this top! absolutely adorable  the pics don't do it justice. it is made of a soft  medium weight jersey material. the lace makes the top more dressey and unique. the drop waiste elongatesy our torso and is loose pleated at the bottom for interest. i am 5'6''  135 pounds  and long waisted. this fits me perfect (sz small.) the pleated bottom on me begins at low hips (below belly button) so it layes nice and is very flattering. no swing to the top no bulky extra flare at al,Knits
1,Perfect in every way- easy to wear-very feminine  comfy and goes with everything. only problem is color is not like picture. it is a mauve not a light pink. i still love this top and the color it camre in. brighten up with lipstick- necklace- earrings- whatever your pick. highly recommend. a winner!!!,Knits
-1,Way too long...the sizing is incredibly off on this product. order a size or two down.,Layering
-1,This top is beautiful - even more so in person. however  like a previous reviewer  the fit is very boxy. there is so much excess fabric that poofs out on the sides that you can't see in the photos due to the model's cardigan and arms. if this top had been a bit longer and more fitted  without all the excess fabric at the bottom  it would have been perfect. again  the color  the lace  the fabric and the pleating is all gorgeous. would love it if the designer took this into consideration and came,Layering

-1,Wow! this sure is close fitting  as in suction cups to your body! yikes  definitely not forgiving for those of us with curves. to me  it seems like the material will wear well. i bought this for a great sales price so i may keep it  not sure. it would work fine as a layering piece but if i gain even 5 lbs  it won't work. i ordered the medium and am usually a small. the large might have worked best but probably still pretty clingy. i do recommend this if you are thin with no problem areas.,Layering
0,I nearly always wear a size small  and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this  and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.,Layering

0,"This spandex top  in my opinion  is workout wear. it is not the tank i expected to receive  but my bad. it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts. it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is  it should fit like this. 5' 5"" 142 lbs medium is skin tight. color is nice but  as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer. quality seems fair.",Layering
0,I love the wide straps but it runs small and is short. still great for layering. great  soft material. i hate that it is so tight and short but if i size up them the arm holes would be way too big.,Layering
0,I loved this when i got it. it has such a flattering fit! slightly loose in the body  but not flowy. nice weight of fabric. comfortable fabric. perfect scoop neck that doesn't show too much cleavage. but i washed it once on delicate and line dried (which i do with most of my shirts) and it came out riddled in holes.,Layering
0,This seemed to run a little bit small on me... more form fitting than on the model in the photo. also  it's thin. i'd be sold on it for sure if it were just a little longer too because i like the almost-lingerie-like look. the lace applique is pretty  and if you purchase it for that  then it really shows up better on the two lighter colors - it really gets lost all in black.,Layering

1,I love this shimmer tank-in both colors! it is a very thin fabric-thinner than i would have expected  but i think this is okay since i would use it for layering and probably never wear it as a standalone tank. i think you can never go wrong with sparkles  especially in a layering tank-it dresses up or fancies up the outfit. the straps on this tank are not adjustable  and if you are large chested  i think a lot of cleavage would show in this tank. i would have preferred the sleeves are very sligh,Layering
1,This is a super flattering  cute tank! i've purchased it in several colors because it's such a great fit. somewhat thin material and slightly sheer (especially the white). i like that it has good coverage on the sleeves so that bra straps nor 'side boob/armpit' fat shows. looks great with pilcro capris for a cute  casual summer look! i wish they would come out with even more colors!,Layering

-1,Given that i am petite with thighs (take a size 6p or 28p) these were not for me! the run small  are really tight from the thigh up  run longer that a petite should and are fairly thin. on top of that the zipper and hook in the back are really inconvenient. i was looking for something i could wear to work  and these were not the right style for that. plus they seemed cheaply made  like they wouldn't stand the test of time. i imagine if you are tall and skinny like the model  they would look good,Pants
-1,I'm petite  but even if i weren't  i think this runs very large  isn't form flattering at all  and overall looks dull. it most definitely does not justify the price. material is thin.,Pants
-1,"I ordered these pants after seeing the good reviews  but i don't agree. these are going back. i ordered a small. i'm 5'5"" and 135 pounds. i am usually between a small and a medium in pants  but the small in these pants is huge. i could definitely fit into an xs. but i also don't think they are very flattering and don't like the feel of the fabric. it's too bad. i love the idea of these.",Pants

0,They were ok pants but too small. the texture and shape were not what i expected either.,Pants
0,Material and color is nice.  the leg opening is very large.  i am 5'1 (100#) and the length hits me right above my ankle.  with a leg opening the size of my waist and hem line above my ankle  and front pleats to make me fluffy  i think you can imagine that it is not a flattering look.  if you are at least average height or taller  this may look good on you.,Pants
0,I ordered a six 6 petite. the pant leg was still very long. and if i have it tailored it will not preserve the whole point of these pants having a flare. this is a slim fit. i have heavy thighs and this was not for me. i'm 5' 120 lbs. also the tag warns that the fabric may leave color on lighter clothing. which i don't get  because it's spandex blend. also wasn't too hip in the zipper on the back.,Pants
0,I was so excited to finally find a work appropriate contemporary pant that i wore them about 3 times in the first week. needless to say they needed to be washed  and i followed the care instructions by washing in cold water and laying flat to dry. after just a single wash in cold water  the pants faded to the point that they looked like they were three years old. so sad  luckily retailer took them back without a problem. be warned  these may need to be dry cleaned which is a lot of maintena,Pants

0,This is really a lovely jumper and looks quite nice and dressy on. my problem is a short torso  but then again this may be made for short torso loving people! i felt like i was all legs in it. i never asked anyone else's opinion  though  so not sure if its just me and my complex. if you don't have a short torso then you might experience the pulling the others were speaking about because the waist might hit you higher than your usual waist.  overall  i am not sure who this was designed for.. but,Pants
0,Like the color and romper style. this runs extremely large. i am normally a petite small and it was too large. with the wide- leg style and overall length you may need to alter this piece.,Pants
0,"The material and construction of the pants are great  but the length is just plain awkward. i'm 5'4"" and the regular came to just above my ankles  and looked as though they had shrunk in the wash in a really bad way. a couple of inches longer and they would've been fine  or i could've gotten them in petite and worn them as true ankle-length pants  but the regular just didn't do it for me. also i'm usually a size 6 (5'4""  125lbs) and these were a little baggy around the waist and hips.",Pants
0,I was thrilled to find a wide-legged pant in a natural fiber and ordered two pairs - l and xl. the l came first and was a tad too close for comfort so i returned it. when the xl arrived it seemed roomy but after my first wear the fold-over jersey knit waistband stretched out and the pants were dragging on the ground. they seem really huge on me and i now have to wear a belt to keep them up. the fabric also seems to be pilling easily- overall not my best retailer purchase (and i am a huge fan,Pants
1,I was a little concerned ordering these online without seeing them in person but they do not disappoint! the fabric has a little texture to it that makes them look and feel like a high quality pant. the design is unique and provides visual appeal  and i still feel like i can wear them in my office without looking out of place. i love the high waist on these!,Pants

1,"I purchased this gaucho as a gift for my mother.  at first  i was about to try it for myself because gaucho is a little trend nowadays.  but later  it turned out that it was a perfect fit for my mother.  it went well with her perhaps because she saved a lot of her fashion from 1980s.  it also fit well with contemporary fashion as well.  however  i think it matches better with vintage fashion than to contemporary fashion.  so  if you happen to save those ""good old fashion""  take them out and try",Pants
1,I love these pants and have two colors from last season. they are well-made and versatile. however  given the amount they stretch and the summer season for sandals  30.5 is a tad long for petite. i'll have them hemmed an inch to keep them from dragging on the floor. also  i wish the coral and green came in petite.,Pants

-1,I loved this romper so much! the material is thin  but perfect for summer. the style is just what i was looking for. it's so so cute and fit perfectly...at first. i wore it one time and then washed it exactly as described on the tag and it shrunk beyond recognition. it went from loose and flowy  like on the model  to little booty shorts and a body suit...not the look i was going for. i am so disappointed.,Shorts
-1,I was hoping these would be like some of the lace shorts i bought from retailer last year that i loved so much. sadly  no. first of all they run small. i am between a s and xs in most brands  bought a s in these because i like my shorts on the looser side. these felt a little snug and short  but i decided to keep them. the first time i washed them  they were ruined. i followed the directions exactly and even put them in a lingerie bag in the washer  plus a delicate cycle  no dryer. the lace is man,Shorts

-1,These are my all time comfiest shorts and i am obsessed with the lavender color. sadly  using free and clear detergent on a cold  delicate cycle made the color turn splotchy  and they are unwearable. this happened once and i exchanged for another pair  but i'll be returning this pair. i'll be sad to see my favorite color go  but there is obviously a defect in the dye used. maybe i'll try another color!,Shorts
-1,Beware. white is not white. white is more cream  off-white  light beige. i was really looking forward to these shorts but was immediately disappointed when i saw the color. they are cute  but not white. i bought them to wear with the nautical look tops for this summer  but unfortunately  creamy colored shorts don't do much for navy/white tops.also  the button is very difficult to open/close.otherwise they are ok.,Shorts
-1,I was disappointed when i got this romper in the mail. the picture looks much cuter than in person. although it's true to size  it looks pretty baggy on. also  i thought the grey (top) and blue (bottom) were too similarly colored; more contrast would have been nice. i'm returning this item.,Shorts

0,I wear an 8-10 and these are a little big on me  which is surprising. they also don't lay really flat in the back. the pockets are inside in the back  in side two layers  and don't lay very flat. the crotch is low and rides up when i walk.  i'll probably wear them again  but i'm not totally thrilled by them.,Shorts
0,I am so sad that this romper didn't work out. it's just way too billowy and huge. i am usually between a small and medium so i ordered this small. i'm petite and somewhat curvy and i was absolutely swimming in this romper! might look best on taller girls. i am 5 '2 and about 125-130 lbs and this was like wearing a tent. do not recommend. such a bummer because i was a believer after treading all of the great reviews!,Shorts
0,"This was so ridiculous on me. i'm 5'8"" 120 usually a 2/xs. so i ordered the xs. the inseam of the shorts are so short they barely cover my bum. and i mean barely. the romper itself was so wide that two of me could have fit in it.  love the colors  fabric  and the non-elasticized waist. if you are under 5'5"" this might work for you in non-petite sizing.",Shorts

0,I bought these for a trip to the caribbean. i sweat a lot. if you have ever been humiliated by having a ring of sweat around your crotch area  then i do not recommend these shorts in the moss color. this color and fabric do not camouflage sweat. i will spare you the photos.,Shorts
0,Fabulous fabric  adorable details. fitting is very  very odd. it's non-adjustable in any way. the fabric has no stretch at all around the middle and the underwire of the bra is very stiff which i found painful. the straps were kind of loose  but there is no way to tighten them because of the frills. when i bent over  the shorts exposed the bottom of my butt. i'd get a larger size  but then i can't adjust the straps and they would definitely be too long and leave my breasts very exposed. overall ,Shorts
1,I can't say enough good things about this romper. i am curvey on the bottom and have never been able to get on board with the romper trend because all the ones i had tried were too short or were clearly made for models and teenagers. this romper is a great length and style for all ages and body types. the material is so soft and is the kind of material that won't easily wrinkle. it can easily be dressed up for a night out with wedges and jewelry or dressed down for day with  flats (and maybe eve,Shorts

1,I like the idea of a skort  and how it is different than everything else out there. this skort is a bit dressy--perfect for a summer party or drinks on the patio at a city cafe. i love that it has pockets. the fabrics used in the patchwork are quality and the tailoring is nice. it fit me true to size. i can't wait for warmer weather to wear it!,Shorts

-1,I bought this in the blue and really wanted to like it--i had plans to check sizing and then order it again in the red  as well! however  this skirt falls victim to the recent design trend of using a pattern for a structured skirt but substituting a softer fabric and (horrors!) an elastic waistband. this ended up just looking kind of cheap and sweatshirty as a result. back it went.,Skirts

1,Super cute  soft  and fuzzy...just like the woodland animals in the pattern. these loungers do run just slightly tight in the seat  so if you have a more developed bottom you should definitely get a size up.,Sleep
1,Been on the hunt for jammie's so gave these a shot. ordered my normal size large. fit well in the waist but i don't like the super wide legs. and they're too long. pretty color and pattern  however  the fabric isn't as soft or cozy as i hoped. i'm retired and wanted pajamas to lounge in all day. these missed the mark for me.,Sleep
-1,"The design of this sweater is odd. it made me feel very ""round"" when i put it on. the sleeves were wide. the other reviewers were correct in saying that it's a thick sweater  which i thought i'd like. the torso was slimmer and longer than i expected. it really was the odd design of the sleeves that made me not like this sweater.",Sweaters

0,I followed the advice of other reviewers and sized down. however  the jacket was still too large. it fit fine in the arms but the body/width of the jacket was huge. also i found the wool material to be extremely itchy. it might work if you are layering it over long sleeves but still make sure to size down at least one or maybe even two sizes.,Sweaters
0,I should have paid more attention to the reviews of this sweater before ordering. although the material looks soft and cozy in the photo  it's very scratchy and uncomfortable. i was also hoping the opening of the collar would be a little wider  which would have been more flattering on me. i never wear turtlenecks of any kind so i took a chance on this. i'm sure others will look fabulous in this sweater and may be happy with it if they don't mind the texture. i'm sending it back.,Sweaters
0,Love the color  cut  and weight (its like a fleece-weight coat  but longer and more appropriate for an office.)  within two wears one of the buttons popped off.  within three wears  one of the back shoulder seams had split.  this coat is lovely but shoddily made. worth it with a discount and if you know how to hand-sew  because minor repairs will be in your future. it is so beautiful but not worth full price at this build quality.,Sweaters

1,I bought this is in the gray color  although imo it has more of a greenish hue. i love it. it's a wide boxy fit like others have said  and tends to fall off the shoulder. i purchased it in the small (my typical size) and it definitely seems to run large (it relaxes too as i wear it  giving it an even roomier feel). that said it's very cozy & comfortable. i wear a tank underneath. works well for 50's and 60's weather.,Sweaters

1,I love hand knit sweaters. they look expensive. this sweater is pricey and i shied away from the original price. at the reduced price  it is worth it. my sweater is bright blue and pure white so not sure what other reviewer got. however  it is itchy. i admit that i have somewhat sensitive skin so if i cannot wear a silk layer under it  or find a way to make it less itchy on me  i will have to reluctantly return it. i normally wear large but the medium fit fine.,Sweaters
-1,The cutout design of this suit looks cute on the model but didn't flatter my shape. i think it would work better on someone very thin. the criss-cross fabric portion was a bit baggy and didn't sit right. even worse  the bust portion made me look flat (and i'm a full c cup).,Swim

-1,The fit on this is so strange. the middle string is definitely too long and the thin halter top offers hardly any lift. the print is lovely and the quality nice for the price. the cups are padded  which is nice i suppose  but would barely cover anything bigger than a c cup i'm guessing. i'm a 32dd  size 8 in pants  and size 4/6 in dresses and i ordered a medium. i also have a long torso  which probably didn't help.,Swim

0,I bought the stained glass top/bottoms. the print is very pretty. however  the tankini top itself is not well-made. the front of it (chest area) turns out so that you can see part of the inside of the suit (which is white). it doesn't lay flat around the top  and so it shows more of your chest on one side. for the price  i don't think it is worth it. i don't like to wear it because it makes me feel uncomfortable.,Swim
